# So to disable the word blacklist or the splitlist, just erase
# every single word in the two text files.
#
# What is the splitlist.txt?
# That is to detect players that types something like this: mc(dot)miality(dot)com
# if (dot) is in that list, it will filter out their attempt to avoid this plugin.
#
# What is stored in the database if used?
# Chat log for use on a website, for instance in Miality's case on the ModCP.
# The players whitelist will also be stored in the database if enabled.
#
# What is "TripplePlusLetters"?
# That is a check for whenever a player sends messages with unecessary use of characters.
# It detects uses like "heeeeeellllllooo?!", and in this case removes the extensive use of e's, o's and l's
# which would instead return "Heelloo!?" as the final message. This will work on whitelisted players as well.
